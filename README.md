A CLI tool for saving, organizing, and retrieving code snippets with integrated version control. Because your brilliant solutions deserve better than being lost in a sea of Stack Overflow tabs.

## Overview

Pocket helps developers save and find code snippets, manage version control, and automate workflows. It's designed to reduce the time spent searching for code you've already written—because let's face it, you've solved this problem before, you just can't remember where you put the solution.

## Features

- **Snippet Management**: Save, search, and reuse code snippets that would otherwise be destined for digital oblivion
- **Semantic Search**: Find snippets using natural language queries, because remembering exact variable names from six months ago is unrealistic
- **Backpacks**: Organize snippets into collections, like folders but with a more adventurous name
- **Version Control**: Built-in Git-like version control system that won't make you question your career choices
- **Workflows**: Chain commands together for automation, because typing the same sequence repeatedly is soul-crushing
- **Cards**: Extend functionality with plugins, for when the base features aren't quite enough

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (the beginning of a beautiful friendship)
cargo install pocket-cli

# Save a snippet (future you will thank present you)
pocket add file.js

# Find a snippet (with eerily human-like understanding)
pocket search "that thing with the loop"

# Use a snippet (the payoff moment)
pocket insert ID file.js
```

## Documentation

- [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) - Getting started without the headaches
- [Command Reference](docs/commands.md) - All the commands you'll forget and need to look up
- [Version Control System](docs/version-control.md) - Version control for humans

## Issues and Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please [create an issue](https://github.com/frgmt0/pocket/issues) on GitHub. Be sure to include details about your environment and the steps to reproduce the problem. The more specific you are, the faster we can help—vague bug reports are the digital equivalent of "it hurts when I do something."

## Version

Current version: `v-pocket-R3B1-nCR2`

I use a versioning system with letter-based releases, because apparently semver was too mainstream. For more information, see my [versioning philosophy](https://blog.frgmt.xyz/03102025-tech).
