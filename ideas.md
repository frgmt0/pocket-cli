vault command to store API keys safely

shield to share snippets but obfuscates/redacts any secrets while maintaining the overall gist of the snippet

melt command to merge 2 snippets into 1. (makes a new snippet entry and deletes the other 2)

rosetta command to transalte to different languages fairly accurately (built in plugin)

constellation - Creates a beautiful ASCII/terminal visualization showing how your snippets relate to each other - which ones are used together, which build on similar patterns, and how they cluster by concept. This gives you insights into your own coding patterns you might not have consciously realized. ( we would need to track codebase evolution likely with pocket's VCS and if thats not enabled we can fall back to reading git commits and such. probably easier that way)

whisper - no AI human readable way to understand the snippet and/or file by extracting functions, docstrings, classes etc and all important features of the code to showcase what the code does

pocket telescope watch  # Watches as you code and suggests snippets in real-time

spotlight to show your most used snippets (all encompassing)

portal for sharing snippets without cloud services or accounts, just easy file transfer (maybe pastebin?)
pocket beacon snippet-id  --- updates the snippet live if possible (only for local network connections)
pocket beacon find --- finds available servers with compatible endpoints so you don't accidentally connect to something else

~~blend for when people have scripts they want to run pocket can do custom hooks~~

blink for when you maybe have 2 similar files and want to quickly compare diffs to make sure that they do different things (pretty sure this is a shell command lol but whatever)

radio - connect your spotify to play music or default to youtube playlist maybe? or local music?

SOME FUNNY COMMANDS:
photobomb - insert random ascii art (maybe a card/plugin?)

achievements - idk gamify pocket to encourage people to explore all the uses of pocket?

WOULD BE SUPER COOL BUT IDK HOW TO DO:
pocket heist stackoverflow "authentication jwt" --top 5  # Legally "steals" top-rated code samples
    Ethically scrapes code examples from popular programming resources, properly attributed but ready for your use.

pocket highlander scan project/  # "There can be only one!" Finds redundant implementations
    Finds multiple implementations of the same functionality and helps consolidate them into a single, optimal solution. This way you can better clean up codebases

pocket wormhole open  # Creates a live connection between codebases
pocket wormhole send function1 --to ../other-project/
    Like `portal` but for an entire codebase or files rather than just snippets
