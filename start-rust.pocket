# Workflow for starting a new Rust project
# Each line is executed as a command chain

# First, search for Rust project setup snippets
search "cargo new project setup"

# Then search for common Rust dependencies
search "rust common dependencies Cargo.toml"

# Look for error handling patterns
search "rust error handling anyhow"
