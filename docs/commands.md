# Pocket CLI Command Reference

## Snippet Management
*Because copy-paste is so 2005*

### Adding Content
*Getting your code bits into the system*

```bash
# Add from a file (the normal way)
pocket add file.js

# Add with inline text (for the impatient)
pocket add -m "console.log('why am I hard-coding this?');"

# Open editor to add content (for the thoughtful types)
pocket add -e

# Add to a specific backpack (organization level: advanced)
pocket add -b backpack_name file.js
```

### Finding Content
*Because what's the point of saving if you can't find it later?*

```bash
# List ALL THE THINGS
pocket list

# List entries in a specific backpack
pocket list --backpack backpack_name

# Search for entries (basic mode)
pocket search "query"

# Search with exact matching (perfectionist mode)
pocket search "query" --exact

# Search in a specific backpack (when you've actually organized things)
pocket search "query" --backpack backpack_name
```

### Using Content
*The payoff for all that meticulous hoarding*

```bash
# Insert a snippet into a file (the magic moment)
pocket insert ID file.js

# Remove a snippet (spring cleaning)
pocket remove ID

# Edit a snippet (because perfection is a process)
pocket edit ID
```

## Organization
*Tools for people who have their life together, or aspire to*

### Backpacks
*Like folders, but more adventurous*

```bash
# Create a new backpack (for when one messy pile isn't enough)
pocket create backpack name

# List entries in a backpack (see what's inside)
pocket list --backpack name
```

### Workflows
*For when you're tired of typing the same commands repeatedly*

```bash
# Execute a workflow (one-liner automation)
pocket lint "search 'query' > insert file.js"

# Save a workflow (for future laziness)
pocket lint --save workflow_name "search 'query' > insert file.js"

# Execute a saved workflow (maximum efficiency)
pocket lint workflow_name

# Delete a workflow (spring cleaning, automation edition)
pocket delete-workflow workflow_name
```

## Version Control
*Git, but with more... something? i'm not sure*
NOTE: STILL IN ALPHA/BETA!!!!! Use at your own risk!

```bash
# Initialize a repository (the beginning of your journey)
pocket new-repo

# Show repository status (what mess have I created?)
pocket status

# Add files to staging area (single file mode)
pocket pile file.js
# Add files to staging area (sweep everything under the rug mode)
pocket pile --all

# Remove files from staging area (single file regret)
pocket unpile file.js
# Remove files from staging area (total regret)
pocket unpile --all

# Create a commit (freeze your work in digital amber)
pocket shove -m "Fixed the thing that wasn't working"
pocket shove -e  # For when your commit deserves an essay

# Show commit history (trip down memory lane)
pocket log
pocket log --verbose  # For when you want ALL the details

# Create a new timeline (branch) (parallel universe mode)
pocket timeline new name

# Switch to a timeline (universe hopping)
pocket timeline switch name

# List timelines (see all your parallel universes)
pocket timeline list

# FUTURE Merge a timeline (universe collision)
pocket merge timeline_name

# FUTURE Add a remote repository (make friends with other computers)
pocket remote add name url

# FUTURE Push to a remote (share your genius)
pocket push remote_name
```

## Cards (Plugins)
*Extend functionality without learning C++*

```bash
# List available cards (see what toys you have)
pocket cards list

# Add a card from GitHub (trust someone else's code)
pocket cards add name url

# Create a new local card (DIY mode)
pocket cards create name "description"

# Build a card (make your code actually work)
pocket cards build name

# Run a card command (the moment of truth)
pocket cards run card_name command [args...]

# Enable/disable a card (power management)
pocket cards enable name
pocket cards disable name

# Remove a card (breakup time)
pocket cards remove name
```

## General
*The meta stuff*

```bash
# Display help (admit defeat)
pocket help
pocket help command

# Display version information (for bragging rights)
pocket version
```

## Utility Commands
*Making your CLI life easier*

### Shell Integration with Blend
*Mixing your shell scripts into your environment*

```bash
# Add a shell script as a shell extension (sourced at shell startup)
pocket blend my_aliases.sh

# Add a shell script as an executable hook (can be run with @name)
pocket blend --executable my_script.sh

# List all installed hooks
pocket blend list

# Edit an existing hook
pocket blend edit hook_name

# Run an executable hook
pocket blend run hook_name [arguments]
# Or, after shell restart:
@hook_name [arguments]
```

The `blend` command provides two ways to integrate scripts with your shell:

1. **Shell Extensions**: Scripts added without the `--executable` flag are sourced when your shell starts, making aliases and functions available in your terminal.

2. **Executable Hooks**: Scripts added with the `--executable` flag can be directly executed using the `@name` prefix or via `pocket blend run`.

For more details, check out the [Shell Hooks](hooks.md) documentation.

## The Fine Print

Remember, with great Pocket power comes great responsibility. These commands can make your coding life dramatically betterâ€”or at least more organized, which is basically the same thing. If something breaks, well... you've got version control, right?

Happy pocketing!
